/*
 * Composite (partially randomised) 2nd-order Trotter.
 *
 * The Hamiltonian is split into two disjoint parts:
 *
 *   - deterministic: the top `length` terms by |c_k|,
 *     sorted lexicographically and applied with step size
 *     `angle_det`;
 *   - randomised: the remaining terms, sampled qDRIFT-style
 *     with step size `angle_rand` to `depth` rotations.
 *
 * One step applies a forward half-sweep of one composite
 * sample at omega = 0.5, then a reverse half-sweep of an
 * independent sample — yielding the symmetric S_2 integrator.
 *
 * Output is the per-sample overlap series.  The PRNG is
 * seeded from `seed` verbatim, identically on every rank;
 * any value is valid, including 0.
